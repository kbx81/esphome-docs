    :description: Instructions for setting up Cold White + Warm White lights.
    :image: brightness-medium.svg

The ``cwww`` light platform creates a cold white + warm white light from 2
:ref:`float output components <output>` (one for each channel). The two channels
can be controlled individually or together.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Example configuration entry
    light:
      - platform: cwww
        name: "Livingroom Lights"
        cold_white: output_component1
        warm_white: output_component2
        cold_white_color_temperature: 6536 K
        warm_white_color_temperature: 2000 K
        constant_brightness: true

.. _cwww_mixing:

Mixing
------

The two channels of this light can be controlled individually by using the ``cold_white`` and ``warm_white`` options of
the :ref:`light control actions <light-turn_on_action>`.

If the color temperature of both lights is supplied, it is also possible to control the two channels together by
setting a color temperature, using the ``white`` (interpreted as brightness) and ``color_temperature`` options. This
calculation assumes that both lights have the same illuminance, which might not always be accurate.

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **cold_white** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id of the float :ref:`output` to use for the cold white channel.
- **warm_white** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The id of the float :ref:`output` to use for the warm white channel.
- **cold_white_color_temperature** (*Optional*, float): The color temperature (in `mireds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mired>`__ or Kelvin)
  of the cold white channel. Note that this option is required to control the mixing from Home Assistant.
- **warm_white_color_temperature** (*Optional*, float): The color temperature (in `mireds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mired>`__ or Kelvin)
  of the warm white channel. Note that this option is required to control the mixing from Home Assistant.
- **constant_brightness** (*Optional*, boolean): When enabled, this will keep the overall brightness of the cold and warm white channels constant by limiting the combined output to 100% of a single channel. This reduces the possible overall brightness but is necessary for some power supplies that are not able to run both channels at full brightness at once. Defaults to ``false``.
- All other options from :ref:`Light <config-light>`.
